# Description

This repository contains all data and code to extend the hybrid-units version of EXIOBASE to account for new innovative steelmaking routes envisaged to be deployed in the EU to meet decarbonization targets for the steel industry. The new model was built by adopting the MARIO open-source framework.   

The database can be used to perform scenario and sensitivity analysis described in an open-access paper (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad5bf1)
